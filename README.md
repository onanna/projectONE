Project One- The Buzzer

The Buzer is your leading provider for all Basketball updates and Drinking spots in your local city. 

Uses the Fantasy Data API & Google Places / Maps.

The App puts the 3 API's together by pulling the logos and team info, then putting it on the page. The google Maps tracks the location of the stadium, and Places puts the bars within the desired radius. 

Giving you an all in one for team Info & local bars near each stadium. Enjoy!
